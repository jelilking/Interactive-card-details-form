## Overview

This project is an interactive card details form from frontend mentor that allows users to input their card information in real time.

### The challenge

The main challenge of this project was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface of the card details.

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

The key takeaways from this project, is that i have been a able to build on form inputs and its properties, i have learn't how to use css grid of form layouts too, i have also be a able to learn more about some javascript funtions and regEx pattern too.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<input
  type="number"
  placeholder="MM"
  oninput="if(this.value.length > this.maxLength) this.value = this.value.slice(0, this.maxLength)"
  minlength="2"
  maxlength="2"
  id="card_month"
  required
/>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  margin: 0;
}

input::placeholder {
  font-family: inherit;
  color: var(--Dark-grayish-violet);
}

input:focus {
  outline-color: hsl(249, 99%, 64%);
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};

function setCardNumber(e) {
  cardNumber.innerText = format(e.target.value);
}

function format(s) {
  return s
    .toString()
    .replace(/(\d{4})/g, "$1 ")
    .trim();
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to woriking on security functions with API KEY's in the future
